<h2>
    From Super Mario to GTA-V and RDR-2 ; the ultimate redemption of gaming industry
</h2>
<p>
    Learning to code can get difficult at times but if you want to have it in a fun way then there’s no better approach to it than Game Development ! Developing games allow you to have a better understanding of problem-solving and enables you to have a better experience in the designing sector as well. Lately, companies have been looking to hire developers with more and more experience in languages like C++, HTML, CSS so it would be an advantage for you if you are learning game development. Also, the pay scale for the game developers is pretty good that can go as high as $100,000. 

</p>
<h2>
    What are the best programming languages to learn for being in the top tier of the game development community ?

</h2>
<p>
    Mainly there are two areas of game development namely system development and web development. System languages are used to develop games that can be played on a local machine whereas web languages allow us to develop games that can be played online on web browsers. 
<br>
C++ is the best system language for developing games but it has a relatively higher entry barrier than languages like Java. It is an object-oriented programming language so it uses internal structures to organize code in a better way. Though it is a language difficult to learn; it has been the most popular language for game development over time because of its excessive control over hardware and graphical processes. In fact, some platforms only accept the code written in C++ so it is the best option to start learning game development with! Java is another system language that also provides the benefits of an object-oriented programming language and can be used for system development.
<br>
For web games, we need to learn a package of languages consisting of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. HTML and CSS are used to give the look to the pages and set up a basic page structure. They are also used to give the display elements in some games. JavaScript is used to have interaction with a web page and when it comes to gaming it can be used to make things move, throw punches and similar action-based tasks can be achieved through it. SQL is used for back-end database work so that the player can access their account and do other things on the server. Very deep knowledge is not required in all these languages for development unless you want to develop a very high-end game.
<br>
Other languages that can be used for game development comprises C#, Python, Lua, and Papyrus. All these languages also have their own pros and cons but the best in the industry currently in 2021 is C++.
</p>
<h2>
    What are the best softwares I can use for game development ?
</h2>
<p>
    Among the best game design software options for beginners to experiment with, GameMaker: Studio 2 (GMS 2), Unity, Unreal Engine 4 are some notable options. Unity is one of the industry’s most powerful and widely used game design software tools, allowing you to create 2D and 3D games for nearly any system—including Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, and Facebook. Unity also requires knowledge in C++ which is another reason to learn C++ for game development. GMS 2 features an easy-to-use drag-and-drop interface for variables and game logic so that you can build entire games without knowing any code. Unreal Engine 4 needs to be learned before it can be used and is also difficult to learn because of the vast variety it provides in the tools. Like other game design software mentioned, Unreal makes it easy to export to popular platforms across mobile devices, computers, gaming consoles, and VR systems.
    <br>
    All these software have different versions ranging from primary to pro. There are various plans available for every software and that can be checked on their respective websites.

    Giants and big players of gaming industry and their approach towards future gaming
</h2>
<p>
    The gaming industry keeps on growing every year and there are always companies that remain at the top of it. Sony remains the biggest video game company in the world in 2021. Its successes in the PlayStation 5 have generated huge revenue. The company’s handheld video game console, the PlayStation Vita, contributed to Sony’s no.1 position on the video game market as well. If the gaming console developers are not taken into consideration and only the video games creators are focused on then Tencent is by far the biggest gaming company. Some notable games from Tencent include Honor of Kings and League of Legends. Nintendo is also a very well-known name in the market of game development and this Japanese-based company does nothing but game development. It’s Animal Crossing: New Horizons is a game that is on the path to becoming the best-selling game for the Nintendo Switch console ever. Other companies that are well-known in game development include Electronic Arts (EA), Epic Games, Microsoft, and Bandai Namco.

    How Does It Feel Like to Work at a Gaming Company ?
</h2>
<p>
    Everyone has a notion that working at a gaming company is really fun but it is not completely the case. You don't get to enjoy your day listening to music or playing games all day. You are an employee there which implies that you will always be having deadlines and the pressure increases the closer you get towards it. The logic behind the game has to be developed and the code has to be written which may take a lot of thinking sometimes. Also, unless you're a well-known & experienced worker with popular titles to your name, you won't make the big bucks anytime soon. But it is worth noting that the culture at gaming companies is quite good and definitely perfect for people with an interest in game development. It should be kept in mind, ‘Gaming is entertainment. Developing one is not’.
